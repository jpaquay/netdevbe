#### What else do you need?

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.

### Stuff I work on

I build trusted relationships with people by listening to their needs and meet them where they are in their digital transformation.

```javascript
const startup = 
    {build: "whats_next"
}
```
I'm a Cloud Architect with Google's [Cloud](http://cloud.google.com) team. I meet innovative teams and together we discuss their future with Google Cloud Platform, ensuring that tough engineering problems are solved, and we elevate to the next step in digitalization.
